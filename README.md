# OOPs Concepts Practice in Java 🧠💻

This repository contains concise Java programs demonstrating key Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts. The purpose of this project is to **revise core OOP principles** through clean and understandable code examples.

## 🚀 Concepts Covered

1. **Encapsulation**  
   → Wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class) with private access modifiers.

2. **Inheritance**  
   → Achieving code reusability by inheriting properties and behavior from parent classes.

3. **Polymorphism**  
   → Same method acting differently based on the context – method overloading & overriding.

4. **Abstraction**  
   → Hiding internal implementation details and showing only essential features using abstract classes.

5. **Interface vs Abstract Class**  
   → Differences, use-cases, and code examples of interface and abstract class usage.
